## Announcing Knative v0.19 Release

A new version of Knative is now available across multiple components.
Follow the instructions in the documentation [Installing Knative](https://knative.dev/docs/install/) for the respective component.

Highlights:
- The monitoring bundle has been removed and the git repository archived.
- Improvements for cold start by adding a scale down delay.
- No longer mounting `/var/log` this allows certain images like `docker.io/nginx` that use this directory to be use as Knative Service.
- New Alpha feature that allows for domain name mapping at namespace scope.
- You specify delivery spec defaults for brokers in Eventing configmap `config-br-defaults`
- Eventing keeps improving stability by squashing bugs.

### Serving v0.19

üö® Breaking
- The deprecated monitoring bundle has been removed ([#9807](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/9807))
- Drop serving v1alpha1 and v1beta1 APIs ([#9617](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/9617), [#9620](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/9620))
- We only mount a volume at `/var/log` if the operator has enabled log collection. Runtime contract `/var/log` requirement has changed from MUST to MAY ([#9683](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/9683)]

üí´ New Features & Changes
- Adds a Scale Down Delay feature, allowing maintaining replica count for a configurable period after request count drops to avoid cold start penalty. ([#9626](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/9626))
- (Alpha) Adds a DomainMapping CRD in v1alpha1, allowing mapping a custom domain name to a Knative Service ([#9714](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/9714), [#9735](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/9735), [#9752](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/9752), [#9796](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/9796), [#9915](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/9915), [#10044](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/10044))
- Adding cluster-wide flag max-scale-limit. This ensures that both cluster-wide flag max-scale and per-revision annotation "autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale" for new revision will not exceed this number. ([#9577](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/9577))
- All of our deployments run with a minimal set of kernel capabilities. ([#9973](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/9973))
- Autoscaler now supports multiple pods. Autoscaler Deployment needs to be scaled to 0 first then scaled to other replica value. ([#9682](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/9682))
- Updated the Service schema to include a high level basic schema. ([#9436](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/9436), [#9953](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/9953))
- Queue-proxies are no longer allow to run as root, they have a read-only root filesystem and have all capabilities dropped. ([#9974](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/9974))
- ResponsiveRevisionGC is enabled by default ([#9710](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/9710))
- Revisions are now named more clearly and consistently. ([#9740](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/9740))

üêû Bug Fixes
- Domain is validated by k8s library IsFullyQualifiedDomainName(). ([#10023](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/10023))
- Fixed a rare nil-pointer exception in the autoscaler ([#9794](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/9794))
- Ingress is reconciled when label was different from desired. ([#9719](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/9719))

### Eventing v0.19

üí´ New Features & Changes
- Config-br-defaults support setting delivery spec defaults ([#4328](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4328))

üêû Bug Fixes
- Fix a bug which could cause eventing-webhook to crashloop on initial creation. ([#4168](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4168))
- Change the image pull policy so sinkbinding source tests work with kind. ([#4317](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4317))
- Dependency readiness could sometimes be missed because mismatched informer/lister was being used in the trigger reconciler. ([#4296](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4296))
- Dispatcher was incorrectly behaving like a normal reconciler instead of skipping status updates. I wonder if this was causing grief battling the normal reconciler. ([#4280](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4280))
- Fix issue [#4375](https://github.com/knative/eventing/issues/4375) where we would not reconcile changes to reconcile policy or duration. ([#4405](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4405))
- Only update the subscriber statuses in IMC after they have been added to handlers. Reduces failures where the
  subscribers have been marked before the dataplane has been actually configured. ([#4435](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4435))
- Retry on network failures ([#4454](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4454))
- ingress / filter now handle proper k8s lifecycle. ([#3917](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/3917))
- KnativeHistory extension is not added anymore to events going through channels ([#4366](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4366))

üßπ Clean up
- Move fuzzer (test related code) to test files so they don't get baked into our binaries. Small reduction in binary size. ([#4399](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4399))
- DeliverySpec validation rejects a negative retry config. ([#4216](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4216))
- Just clean up some unused fields from the mtbroker reconciler struct. ([#4318](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4318))
- Point to Broker ref instead of using a hard coded path. Also makes things little easier to reuse against other brokers. ([#4278](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4278)))
- Reducing places where we pull in fuzzers. ([#4447](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4447))
- Simplify the IMC implementation, reduce churn due to global resyncs. ([#4359](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4359))
- Use github action to run codecov. ([#4237](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4237))
- remove all knative fuzzers from our binaries. ([#4402](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4402))
- Move ContainerSource to v1 API. ([#4257](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4257))
- Eventing now tests the supported Kubernetes version range pre-submit. ([#4273](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4273)))
- Run kind e2e tests every 4 hours on Github actions. ([#4412](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4412))
- Updated go-retryablehttp to v0.6.7 ([#4423](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4423))
