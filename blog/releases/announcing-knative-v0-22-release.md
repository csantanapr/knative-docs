### Serving v0.22

<!-- Original notes are here: https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/tag/v0.22.0 -->

#### üí´ New Features & Changes

- Added an autoscaling annotation to choose a different aggregation algorithm for the autoscaling metrics. This is experimental currently. [#10840](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/10840)
- Added autocreateClusterDomainClaims flag to network config map. [networking/#330](https://github.com/knative/networking/pull/330)

#### üêû Bug Fixes

- Adds validation that a default max-scale is set if a max-scale-limit is specified in the autoscaler configmap (since otherwise the default max-scale, i.e. 0 = no max, would fail validation as it is above the max-scale-limit). [#10921](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/10921)
- Bumped the resource request and limits of the autoscaler to 100m/100Mi, 1000m/1000Mi respectively. [#10865](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/10865)
- Fixed a regression where the pod bringup time might have a latency of 10s or more even though the container should be up quickly. [#10992](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/10992)
- Reduced the necessary memory allocations in the activator significantly, especially with disabled tracing. [#11016](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11016), [#11013](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11013), [#11009](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11009), [#11008](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11008)
- Fix the incorrect Gateway name format for DomainMapping auto TLS feature for net-istio implmenetation. [net-istio#532](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-istio/pull/532)


### Eventing v0.22

<!-- Original notes are here: https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/tag/v0.22.1 -->

#### üö® API Changes

- v1alpha1 Channel duck types are no longer supported. [#5005](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/5005)
- Allow Trigger users to set another namespace's Subscriber, And when Subscriber's namespace not been set, it will be set to Trigger's namespace [#4995](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4995)

#### üêû Bug Fixes

- Fix PingSource adapter not always releasing the leader election lease when terminating [#5162](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/5162)
- Fix PingSource sending duplicate events when the leading adapter fails to renew its lease [#4908](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4908)
- Fix bug preventing the namespace-scoped in-memory channel to become ready. [#4906](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/)
- Fix excessive number of Replicas for eventing-webhook [#5112](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/5112)
- Webhook timeout for API server calls has been increased to 10 seconds. [#5175](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/5175)

#### üßπ Clean up

- Do not set the finalizer for pingSource for pingSource controller, just deal with it in reconcilekind [#5002](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/5002)

### Eventing Extensions


#### Eventing Kafka Broker v0.22

<!-- Original notes are here: https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-kafka-broker/releases/tag/v0.22.1 -->

#### üö® Breaking or Notable

- Kubernetes's minimum version is 1.18. [#779](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-kafka-broker/pull/779)

#### üí´ New Features & Changes

- Support ordered delivery.
  - You can choose between ordered and unordered delivery through the label kafka.eventing.knative.dev/delivery.order in your triggers.
  - Check out the docs for more details at https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/broker/kafka-broker . [#589](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-kafka-broker/pull/)

#### üêû Bug Fixes

- Add producer interceptor io.cloudevents.kafka.PartitionKeyExtensionInterceptor to provide ordered delivery based on the partitioning extension of the CloudEvents spec. [#751](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-kafka-broker/pull/751)
- Fix unable to deploy KafkaSink without Kafka Broker installed [#714](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-kafka-broker/pull/714)

### Client v0.22

<!-- Original notes are here: https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/tag/v0.22.1 and https://github.com/knative/client/blob/main/CHANGELOG.adoc#v0220-2021-04-06 -->

kn 0.22.0 comes with some bug fixes and minor feature enhancements. It's mostly a polishing release. If you are using the client API, there is a breaking change that was needed to align with Kubernetes client API's

#### META
The compile dependencies have been updated to Knative Serving 0.22.0 and Knative Eventing 0.22.0. There are no changes in the used API version for communicating with the backend.

#### Managing custom domain mappings

This release adds support for CRUD management of domain mappings. I.e. you can use `kn domain` along with its sub-commands `create`, `update`, `describe`, `list` and `delete` to fully manage DomainMapping resources for the installation of custom domains for Knative services.

```
# Create a domain mappings 'hello.example.com' for Knative service 'hello'
kn domain create hello.example.com --ref hello

# Update a domain mappings 'hello.example.com' for Knative service 'hello'
kn domain create hello.example.com --refFlags hello

# List all domain mappings
kn domain list

# Delete domain mappings 'hello.example.com'
kn domain delete hello.example.com
```
See `kn domain help` for more information.


#### Client API signature change

A `context.Context` object is added as the first argument to every Client API method to align with Kubernetes' client API signatures. This change does not affect any client's CLI usage, only if the client-specific Golang API is used for communicating with the Knative backend has changed. The migration is straight forward, either pass an already existing context down to the call or leverage one of the available standard contexts (like `context.TODO()`).

This change does _not_ affect any CLI usage of the client.

### CLI Plugins

#### üí´ New Features & Changes

The plugins that are released aligned with 0.22 are:

- [kn-plugin-admin](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/kn-plugin-admin) for managing Knative installations that are running on Kubernetes | [download](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/kn-plugin-admin/releases/tag/v0.22.0)
- [kn-plugin-source-kafka](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/kn-plugin-source-kafka) for managing a Kafka Source that has been installed via [eventing-kafka](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-kafka) on the backend | [download](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/kn-plugin-source-kafka/releases/tag/v0.22.0)

### Minor CLI updates

- Fix `kn export` uses the _Export_ format as the default
- Added `S` column to specify built-in sources in `kn source list-types`
- Added support for namespaces for all commands that takes a `--sink` option

### Operator v0.22

<!-- Original notes are here: https://github.com/knative/operator/releases/tag/v0.22.1 -->

#### üêû Bug Fixes

- Delete the installed ingress resources only [#548](https://github.com/knative/operator/pull/548)
- Allow the update of ingress resources with spec.additionalManifests [#531](https://github.com/knative/operator/pull/531)
- Refactor the cache mechanism [#532](https://github.com/knative/operator/pull/532)
- Filter the redundant resources in the target manifest [#509](https://github.com/knative/operator/pull/509)
